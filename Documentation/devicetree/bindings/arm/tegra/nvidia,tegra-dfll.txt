NVIDIA Tegra DFLL clock source node. DTS board level data.

Required properties:
- board-params : phandle pointing to the board-specific configuration data
  for this DFLL instance.

Optional properties:
- i2c-quiet-output-workaround : If the DFLL IP block version implemented on
  this SoC requires the I2C output to the PMIC to be quiesced before disabling
  it, this property should be set.
- monitor-data-new-workaround : If the DFLL IP block version implemented on
  this SoC may erroneously clear DFLL monitor data new indicator, this property
  should be set.
- dynamic-output-lut-workaround : If the DFLL IP block version implemented on
  this SoC does not support dynamic change of DFLL output limits register
  fields, this property should be set.

  Tegra210 SoC flow controller can override DFLL settings depending on SoC CPU
  power state. The following properties provide configuration options for DFLL
  calibration on such platform. They are applied only to "nvidia,tegra210-dfll"
  compatible DFLL.
- defer-force-calibrate :
  "set" - target DFLL rates are calibrated accurately, minimum reached voltage
  is one PMIC step above minimum allowed voltage;
  "not set" - DFLL rates may deviate by 2-3 reference clock rates above the
  target, minimum reached voltage is at minimum allowed level.
- calibrate-force-vmin :
  "set" - DFLL rates are calibrated accurately, minimum reached voltage is at
  minimum allowed level, DFLL may be under-clocked by 2-3 reference clock rates
  for 3 sampling periods during calibration
  "not set" - DFLL is accurate or over-clocked depending on defer-force-calibrate
  setting.

- status : device availability -- managed by the DT integration code.

- i2c-pmic-integration : phandle pointing to the integration data for
  PMIC controlled by this DFLL instance via I2C interface.

Optional subnode:
- pwm-pmic-integration : should have integration data for PMIC controlled by
  this DFLL instance via PWM interface.

Note that one and only one of 'i2c-pmic-integration', or 'pwm-pmic-integration',
must be included.

Example:

dfll@70110000 {
        board-params = <&{/cpu_dfll_board_params}>;
        i2c-pmic-integration = <&{/cpu_dfll_pmic_integration}>;
