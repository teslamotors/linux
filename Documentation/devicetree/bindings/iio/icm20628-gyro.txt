* Invensense ICM-20628 and MPUxxxx Gyro/Accelerometer(/compass) sensors

This driver uses the NVidia Sensor (NVS) framework.
See the nvs.txt documentation for NVS DT capabilities.
The nvi sensor driver supports the ICM, MPU6xxx and MPU9xxx devices.

Required properties:
- compatible: Device or generic name.
	      Supported device names:
	      - invensense,mpu6xxx
	      - invensense,mpu6050
	      - invensense,mpu6500
	      - invensense,mpu6515
	      - invensense,mpu9150
	      - invensense,mpu9250
	      - invensense,mpu9350
	      - invensense,icm20628
  Note: If the part is known and is populated, then it can be specified:
	Example: compatible = "invensense,icm20628";
	When specifying a device this way, the driver will assume this specific
	device is populated during system boot and will not verify its
	existence.  If, however, the device is unknown or may not be populated,
	then the label, mpu6xxx, (Example: compatible = "invensense,mpu6xxx";),
	must be used.  This tells the driver to find which device is used.  If
	the device is not found, the driver will unload itself.  This requires
	regulators to be setup correctly for the probe function.
- reg: i2c address of the device. It should be 0x68 or 0x69.
- interrupt-parent:  GPIO number
- interrupts:  GPIO macro

Optional properties:
- status: set to "ok" or "okay" for normal operation.  Set to anything else
	  to unload the driver without ever communicating with the device.
  Note: The "anything else" above is typically "disabled".
	Since the driver will unload without communicating with the device, the
	device will be left in its POR state.
- accelerometer_disable: Setting this property to <1> will disable the
                         accelerometer.
- gyroscope_disable: Setting this property to <1> will disable the gyroscope.
- gyro_temp_disable: Setting this property to <1> will disable the gyroscope
                     temperature sensor.
  Note: To disable the entire device so that the driver unloads, all sensors
        must be disabled:
	accelerometer_disable = <1>;
	gyroscope_disable = <1>;
	gyro_temp_disable = <1>;
- vdd-supply: regulator supply for the chip
- vlogic-supply: regulator supply for the chip
  Note: These are required if the driver is to control the regulators.
- accelerometer_matrix:  Orientation matrix for this device.
- gyroscope_matrix:  Orientation matrix for this device.

Example:
	icm20628@69 {
		compatible = "invensense,mpu6xxx";
                reg = <0x69>;
                interrupt-parent = <&gpio>;
                interrupts = <TEGRA_GPIO(X, 2) 0x01>;
		accelerometer_matrix = [00 ff 00 ff 00 00 00 00 ff];
		gyroscope_matrix = [00 ff 00 ff 00 00 00 00 ff];
	};
