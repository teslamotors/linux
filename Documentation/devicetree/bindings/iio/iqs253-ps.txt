* IQS2x3 proximity sensor

nvs_ drivers use the NVidia Sensor (NVS) framework.
See the nvs.txt documentation for NVS DT capabilities.
The nvs_iqs2x3 proximity sensor driver supports the IQS253 and IQS263 devices.

Required properties:
- compatible: Device or generic name.
	      Supported device names:
	      - azoteq,iqs2x3
	      - azoteq,iqs253
	      - azoteq,iqs263
  Note: If the part is known and is populated, then it can be specified:
	Example: compatible = "azoteq,iqs263";
	When specifying a device this way, the driver will assume this specific
	device is populated during system boot and will not verify its
	existence.  If, however, the device is unknown or may not be populated,
	then the label, iqs2x3, (Example: compatible = "azoteq,iqs2x3";),
	must be used.  This tells the driver to find which device is used.  If
	the device is not found, the driver will unload itself.  This requires
	regulators to be setup correctly for the probe function.
- reg: i2c address of the device. It is one of 0x44-0x47.
- gpio_rdy: GPIO to be used for the I2C handshake with the sensor.
  Note: the gpio_rdy GPIO will be used as an interrupt also.

The IQS devices have a very versatile register set.  So much so that the entire
register set values can be different among platforms.  Because of this, the way
and the values used are defined in the device tree.  The driver will read in
the DT block of data for each command into a buffer and parse the byte stream
to execute the command.
The format for each entry of the command is as follows:
	u8 LENGTH	// The number of data byte pairs (data[N] / 2).
	u8 REGISTER	// The register to write to.
	u8 DATA[N]	// The stream of data bytes.  See below description.
The DATA[N] contains N number of register values first and then N number of a
mask byte corresponding to the Nth data byte.  For example, if 0x12, 0x34 is to
be written to a register, and only bits 4:1 are to be written for the first
byte, then the byte stream would be: 0x12, 0x34, 0x1E, 0xFF.  Where 0x1E is the
mask for the first byte 0x12, and 0xFF is the mask for the second byte 0x34.
The entry for this example if the register is, say, 0x56, would be:
02, 56, 12, 34, 1E, FF

The IQS has a funky register set in that each register has its own register
length.  The reason LENGTH is still used is that maybe only the first few bytes
of a register are to be written.  For example, a register that is 20 bytes long
can get by with defining, say 4 for LENGTH, and only the first 4 bytes will be
written.

The DT labeling mechanism is based on the part number and the command to be
accomplished. Currently there are four main commands: initialization, enable,
disable, and event.  For each label, a "_?" is appended where ? is a decimal
number starting at 0.  Note the driver will put the entries in the sequence
defined by ? and not by the order defined in the DT.
An example for initialization of the IQS263 part in the DT is as follows:
	263init_0 = [05 09 40 03 00 01 03 FF FF FF FF FF]; // 5 bytes to reg 9
	263init_1 = [01 0D 09 FF]; // 1 byte written to register 0x0D
	263init_2 = [01 01 00 FF]; // 1 byte written to register 0x01
	263init_3 = [05 07 1B 08 08 00 11 FF FF FF FF FF]; // 5 bytes to reg 7
	263init_4 = [08 0A 08 10 10 02 04 08 14 3F FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF];
	263init_5 = [03 0B 00 64 80 FF FF FF]; // 3 bytes written to reg 0x0B

The IQS parts have two "virtual" sensors: SAR_proximity and SAR_touch.
The "virtual" means that the NVS framework will split these two sensors so that
the system will see two individual sensors.
The SAR_proximity detects objects near the platform whereas the SAR_touch
detects actual touches with the platform (assuming it's the screen).
Because there are two sensors, there are two enable labels: <part>en_prox and
<part>en_touch.
Here is a DT example of the enable commands for both sensors:
	263en_prox_0 = [01 09 10 18];	// 1 byte written to register 0x09
	263en_prox_1 = [FF 00];		// this is an I2C write with no delay.
	263en_prox_2 = [01 09 08 18];	// 1 byte written to register 0x09
	263en_touch_0 = [01 09 10 18];	// 1 byte written to register 0x09
	263en_touch_1 = [FF 00];	// write flush.  See description below.
	263en_touch_2 = [01 09 08 18];	// 1 byte written to register 0x09
Here are the possible disable command labels:
	263dis_prox_?
	263dis_touch_?
	253dis_prox_?
	253dis_touch_?
The disable commands do not need to write to the registers to put the device to
sleep.  When the driver sees that all the sensors are disabled it will handle
the global sleep.
The event command allows any necessary action whenever the device receives an
event:
	263event_?
	253event_?
If partial ATI is enabled, the driver will automatically handle the reseeding.
The suspend command allows any necessary action whenever the driver receives
notification of a suspend:
	263suspend_?
	253suspend_?
The external state is the sar_external_status function that an external driver
can call to notify the IQS driver of an external status.  It's purpose is for
WARs and is therefore defined by the WAR implemented in the device tree byte
stream "external_lo" and "external_hi" when the external state transitions to
low and high respectively.
	263external_lo_?
	253external_lo_?
	263external_hi_?
	253external_hi_?

Due to the IQS device's design for communicating with the device, each entry,
which represents an I2C transaction, is actually stacked so that the entire
command is executed as a single I2C transaction.  That is, I2C restarts are
done instead of I2C stops.  For situations where it is desired to write the
transactions thus far and have a delay within the command entries, the LENGTH
can be set to FF.  This tells the driver's byte stream parsing engine to
execute the I2C transactions thus far and if a millisecond delay is to also be
done, then the following byte contains the number of milliseconds to wait,
otherwise the following byte's value is 0.
The FF does NOT need to be entered at the end of a byte stream command.  The
driver's byte stream parsing engine will automatically execute the I2C
transactions.
It is strongly recommended to not use the flush write within an event command
byte stream.

FYI, internally to the driver, the byte stream terminates when LENGTH is 0.
This is handled automatically by the driver's DT parsing, but is an FYI so that
0 is never used for LENGTH.
The driver's DT parsing engine has error checking and will exit with an error
of "ERR: NOMEM @ %s" where %s will be the DT label where things went south.
The error can be due to truly out of buffer memory to non-existent register or
incorrect register length.  Once the driver has loaded, a debug feature that
will dump the parsed byte stream can be done by doing the following at the
device's sysfs directory in an adb terminal prompt:
#echo 0xXXYYZZ1E > nvs
where XX = part device ID (0x29=IQS253, 0x3C=IQS263)
           If XX is 0, then the part in use will be used.
      YY = command
           Possible commands are:
	   1: initialization
	   2: enable
	   3: disable
	   4: event
	   5: suspend
	   6: delta (see delta options far below)
	   7: external state low
	   8: external state high
	   If YY is 0, then all the commands will be displayed.
      ZZ = device
	   Possible devices are:
	   1: SAR_proximiy
	   2: SAR_touch
	   If ZZ is 0, then all the devices will be displayed.
Ideally, the 0x1E command would always be used.  However, if not all the data
or corruption is displayed due to an undersized buffer (out of the driver's
control) then the above formatting allows less data to be shown at once.
#cat nvs
The results for 0x1001E will be something like:
	iqs263 initialization:
	len=5 reg=9 data/mask=40/ff 3/ff 0/ff 1/ff 3/ff
	len=1 reg=d data/mask=9/ff
	len=1 reg=1 data/mask=0/ff
	len=5 reg=7 data/mask=1b/ff 8/ff 8/ff 0/ff 11/ff
	len=8 reg=a data/mask=8/ff 10/ff 10/ff 2/ff 4/ff 8/ff 14/ff 3f/ff
	len=3 reg=b data/mask=0/ff 64/ff 80/ff
The results for 0x2001E will be something like:
	iqs263 SAR_proximity enable:
	len=1 reg=9 data/mask=10/18
	flush write and mdelay=0
	len=1 reg=9 data/mask=8/18
	iqs263 SAR_touch enable:
	<empty>

Also, a register dump can be done:
#echo 4 > nvs
#cat nvs
During the tuning process, a debug feature can write a byte to a register:
#echo 0xXXYYZZ1D > nvs
where XX = the register
      YY = the register offset
      ZZ = the byte value
Other driver debug commands:
#echo 0x??1C > nvs
writes ?? to the gpio_sar GPIO.
#echo 0x??1B > nvs
writes ?? to the gpio_rdy GPIO.
#echo 0x1A > nvs
switches the gpio_rdy GPIO to input.
#echo 0x19 > nvs
toggles SAR GPIO status message spew.
#echo 0x18 > nvs
toggles external state status message spew.

For overall status information:
#echo 10 > nvs
#cat nvs
The results will be something like:
	IQS driver v. 21
	ATI redo count=0
	os_options=0
	stream_mode=2
	watchdog_timeout_ms=30000
	i2c_ss_delay_ns=1000000
	i2c_retry=10
	gpio_rdy_retry=25
	gpio_rdy_delay_count=2000
	gpio_rdy_delay_us_min=100
	gpio_rdy_delay_us_max=1000
	gpio_rdy 1=1
	gpio_sar 173=0
	gpio_sar_assert_polarity=0
	gpio_sar_dev_assert=SAR_proximity
	gpio_sar_dev_deassert=SAR_proximity
	gpio_sar_suspend_assert=1
	deferred_resume_ms=3000
	resume=0
	SAR_delta_channel_mask=5
	SAR_delta_average_count=10
	irq=2
	irq_disable=0
	irq_trigger_edge=0
	SAR_proximity_binary_hw=1
	SAR_touch_binary_hw=1
When this status is read, the ATI redo count will reset to 0.

In the case the part populated could be either IQS253 or IQS263, both the 253
and 263 commands can be defined in the DT.  The driver will use the one
according to the part identified.

Optional properties:
- status: set to "ok" or "okay" for normal operation.  Set to anything else
	  to unload the driver without ever communicating with the device.
  Note: The "anything else" above is typically "disabled".
	Since the driver will unload without communicating with the device, the
	device will be left in its POR state.
	This device's POR comes up in an operational mode and will draw power.
	If it is desired to unload the driver leaving the device in a low power
	sleep state, then use the individual sensor disable mechanism below.
- SAR_proximity_disable: Setting this property to <1> will disable the
                         SAR proximity.
- SAR_touch_disable: Setting this property to <1> will disable the
                           touch sensor.
  Note: To disable the entire device so that the driver unloads, all sensors
        must be disabled:
	SAR_proximity_disable = <1>;
	SAR_touch_disable = <1>;
- vddhi-supply: regulator supply for the chip
  Note: This is required if the driver is to control the regulator.
- gpio_sar: GPIO to be used for sending proximity event for SAR sensor.
  Note: The gpio_sar define is not required if the following is true:
	- The device's PO pin is wired to the device requiring the SAR event.
	- The assert level is high.
	- The IQS SAR_proximity is configured as a binary value.
- gpio_sar_assert_polarity: assert level of the GPIO for the SAR event.
  Note: gpio_sar_assert_polarity is ONLY for the SAR GPIO and is not needed if
	the GPIO assert value is low since low is the SAR GPIO assert default.
	It may still be defined as low (gpio_sar_assert_polarity = <0>;)
	however.
- gpio_sar_dev_deassert: Which IQS device controls the deassertion of the SAR
                         GPIO.  In other words, the SAR GPIO will deassert
			 according to the gpio_sar_assert_polarity when the
			 sensor specified in gpio_sar_dev_deassert deasserts.
- gpio_sar_dev_assert: Which IQS device controls the assertion of the SAR GPIO.
                       In other words, the SAR GPIO will assert according to
		       the gpio_sar_assert_polarity when the sensor specified
		       in gpio_sar_dev_assert asserts.
  Note: The SAR GPIO can also be used for debug purposes.  When set to one of
        the debug options, the SAR GPIO will not be controlled by one of the
	SAR sensors but instead the debug function.
	The gpio_sar_dev options are:
	- SAR_proximity
	- SAR_touch
	- SAR_delta
	- debug_i2c
	SAR_proximity is the default if no entry is made.
	Due to this device's I2C "issues", the debug_i2c option will assert the
	SAR GPIO (according to the gpio_sar_assert_polarity) when an I2C
	transaction is about to start and deasserts when the I2C transaction
	finishes.
- SAR_<device>_debounce_lo: Each SAR sensor (proximity and touch) in HW binary
                            mode can be debounced.  To enable this feature, set
			    this option to a value > 0.  The lo feature will
			    allow the data state to go low only after the
			    number of consecutive low reads defined here.
- SAR_<device>_debounce_hi: Each SAR sensor (proximity and touch) in HW binary
                            mode can be debounced.  To enable this feature, set
			    this option to a value > 0.  The hi feature will
			    allow the data state to go high only after the
			    number of consecutive high reads defined here.
 Note: For the SAR_<device>_debounce_X feature the following devices are:
       - proximity
       - touch
       It is allowed to define only one level.  For example, if only:
       SAR_proximity_debounce_hi = <5>;
       is defined, then the SAR_proximity device's data output will only
       go high after 5 consecutive reads of it being high.  When the
       SAR_proximity goes low, it is immediately reported as low.  If the lo is
       defined, then it would only go back to low after the consecutive low
       reads defined.
       When the device is enabled with this feature enabled, the data state is
       assumed low.  In other words, if the device's data state when enabled
       is low, it will be reported as low.
       The default value for this is 0 which disables the feature.

- gpio_sar_suspend_assert: If the device is not configured to operate during
			   suspend then this determines the SAR GPIO setting
			   during suspend:
			   -1 = DISABLE: SAR GPIO remains at current state from
			                 when device was operational.
		           0 = !ASSERT: GPIO is not asserted according to
			                gpio_sar_assert_polarity.
		           1 = ASSERT: GPIO is asserted according to
		                       gpio_sar_assert_polarity.
- os_options: If the IQS device is to be controlled by the OS then set this
	      value to 2.  The default is 0.
	      The options are:
	      0 = IQS_OS_NONE: SAR sensor names all begin with "SAR".
	      1 = IQS_OS_VISIBLE: SAR sensor names all begin with "sar".
	      2 = IQS_OS_CONTROL: SAR sensor names all begin with "sar" and the
	                          OS can control enable.
  Note: The visibility to the OS is controlled by changing the case of the
        "SAR" part of the sensor's name.  The NVS HAL looks for the lower case
	version of the sensor name via the NVS framework's NvspDriver
	structure.  When os_options is > 0 the NVS HAL is able to find the SAR
	sensors and populate the OS sensor list.  However, unless os_options is
	set to IQS_OS_CONTROL, the OS will be tricked into thinking it has
	control.  In other words, if os_options is not set to IQS_OS_CONTROL
	the SAR is automatically enabled when the driver loads and the enable
	control is ignored.
- irq_trigger_edge: Set to 1 if interrupt is to configured as
		    IRQF_TRIGGER_FALLING.  Otherwise the interrupt will be
		    configured as IRQF_TRIGGER_LOW.  Using IRQF_TRIGGER_LOW
		    addresses false triggers while the interrupt is disabled
		    during the forced communication protocol.
- stream_mode: The device triggers an interrupt on every device data cycle.
  Note: As mentioned above, the IQS devices have an, um, interesting mechanism
        for communication where there is a small window of time where the
	device will respond to I2C commands (the reason for I2C transaction
	stacking).  When stream mode is disabled, the driver uses a combination
	of disabling/enabling the interrupt, which also doubles in forcing the
	communication window, and reading the device's status and data via
	stream and event modes.  The mechanism allows the device to not
	interrupt the AP unless an event has occured, thereby saving power.
	However, depending on how the device is configured by the DT commands,
	it may be desirable to disable this feature and continually stream the
	data instead.
	If the IQS has the slider enabled the device will stream automatically
	during a slider event.  In this case, the disabling/enabling stream
	mode mechanism above may not be needed and can be disabled by entering
	the auto value for steam_mode.
	Possible stream_mode values are:
	0 = OFF: Event mode will automatically be enabled by the driver and the
	         above communication mechanism described above used.
	1 = ON:  Streaming mode is enabled.  No special communication mechanism
	         is needed since driver gets constantly interrupted with a comm
		 window.  However, the interrupts may be throttled (disabled
		 for a period).
	2 = AUTO: Event mode is enabled but the special communication mechanism
	          described above is not used.  Instead, it is expected and
		  required that the device be configured with the slider
		  enabled to allow for automatic device initiated streaming.
- watchdog_timeout_ms: When streaming mode is disabled, a watchdog can
		       periodically stream the data to confirm the device's
		       status.
  Note: The watchdog timer is actually recommended by Azoteq.
	If this is not defined, the default will be 30 seconds.
- deferred_resume_ms: The delay in milliseconds of when to execute the resume.
                      Due to the time consumed trying to communicate with the
		      device, suspend and resume can be adversely affected.
		      This setting allows resume to be deferred for the amount
		      of time specified; consider the situation where the
		      system resumes for a very short period and then suspends
		      again.  If this situation happened within this deferred
		      resume time, then the whole process of resuming and
		      suspending again would not require any communication with
		      the device thereby not affecting the overall system.
- i2c_retry: The number of times to try an I2C transaction before bailing.
- gpio_rdy_retry: The number of times to try forcing a communication window.
  Note: When I2C communication is attempted outside the communication window by
	pulling the gpio_rdy GPIO low (the GPIO also doubles as the interrupt),
	the i2c_retry and gpio_rdy_retry provide the limits before the driver
	will consider the communication attempt a failure.
	The defaults are 10 and 25 respectively.  The sequence of events for a
	communication attempt are:
	1. disable gpio_rdy interrupt
	2. assert gpio_rdy GPIO low
	3. wait 11ms according to Azotec spec
	4. release gpio_rdy GPIO
	5. gpio_rdy_retry--
	5. wait ~750us according to Azotec spec
	6. if gpio_rdy not low and gpio_rdy_retry > 0 then step 2.
	If all is well so far, do I2C transaction(s), but if an I2C failure,
	then repeat above steps. This is done i2c_retry times before exiting as
	a failure.
	BTW, this is all done according to the Azotec spec.
- gpio_rdy_delay_count: The delay loop count of polling for the GPIO RDY signal
                        to go low.
- gpio_rdy_delay_us_min: The minimum delay in microseconds of the delay in the
			 loop of polling for the GPIO RDY signal to go low.
- gpio_rdy_delay_us_max: The maximum delay in microseconds of the delay in the
			 loop of polling for the GPIO RDY signal to go low.
  Note: The gpio_rdy_delay_* variables are used in the function that checks for
        the gpio_rdy GPIO low level in a loop.  If the level is high a sleep is
	done using the gpio_rdy_delay_us_min/max and the loop continues for
	gpio_rdy_delay_count interations.
- i2c_ss_delay_ns: The I2C bus must be idle for 100us after an I2C transaction
                   with the IQS device or it will hold the I2C clock low.  This
		   WAR is already accounted for in the driver but the delay can
		   be redefined here.
There may a situation where intermittent noise on a channel is causing
unreliable data.  If this is the case, the delta options below can help
determine the proximity state.  This is accomplished by creating virtual delta
SW sensors for each channel.  Each SW sensor created will have the name
SAR_delta_chX, where X is the channel number and the data acquired is the delta
data from the HW pertaining to that channel.  By defining a delta algorithm in
the device tree that can use each SW sensor's data, a global SW delta sensor
named SAR_delta is used as the final result of the algorithm.  Each algorithm
entry in device tree uses the following stucture:
struct iqs_delta_tst {
	int ch;
	int lt;
	int gt;
};
The DT algorithm uses two levels of conditionals.  The first level uses the
label SAR_delta_test_X_Y, where X is the entry number and Y is one of the
members of the iqs_delta_tst structure.  If all of the first level entrie's
conditions result as true, then the second level of conditionals named
SAR_delta_test_true_X_Y are executed.  If any of the first level entrie's
conditions result in false, then the second level of conditionals named
SAR_delta_test_false_X_Y are executed.  The result of the second level of
conditionals is the data for the SAR_delta virtual SW sensor.
Four entries are allowed for each level of conditionals.  Each entry must not
use a negative value.  Each entry must have a valid channel (0 - 3) and at
least one of the conditional values.  Here are how the conditionals are used,
where d[ch] is the channels SAR_delta_chX delta data which may be a moving
average if that feature is enabled (see SAR_delta_average_count below):
Entry:
	SAR_delta_test_0_ch = <0>;
	SAR_delta_test_0_lt = <50>;
Conditional:
	if (d[0] < 50)
Entry:
	SAR_delta_test_0_ch = <1>;
	SAR_delta_test_0_gt = <50>;
Conditional:
	if (d[1] > 50)
Entry:
	SAR_delta_test_0_ch = <2>;
	SAR_delta_test_0_lt = <50>;
	SAR_delta_test_0_gt = <100>;
Conditional:
	if (d[2] < 50 || d[2] > 100)
Entry:
	SAR_delta_test_0_ch = <3>;
	SAR_delta_test_0_lt = <100>;
	SAR_delta_test_0_gt = <50>;
Conditional:
	if (d[3] > 50 && d[3] < 100)
Note how ranges can be used depending on whether the lt value is less than or
greater than the gt value.
The conditionals can be displayed at runtime with the following command in the
driver space:
#echo 0x6001E > nvs
The following are the results from the DT example below:
#cat nvs
DELTA conditions:
SAR_delta_test:
if (ch2 < 75)
if SAR_delta_test_true:
if (ch0 > 5)
if (ch2 > 5 && ch2 < 50)
if SAR_delta_test_false:
if (ch0 > 5)
if (ch2 > 75 && ch2 < 90)

- SAR_delta_channel_mask: The channel mask of the SW delta sensors to create.
			  A value of 0 disables the feature.  The default is 0.
- SAR_delta_average_count: The delta values for each channel can use a moving
                           average.  This value sets the number of samples to
			   use for each average calculation.  A value < 2
			   disables the feature.  The default is 0.

And finally, an example:

	iqs263@44 {
		compatible = "azoteq,iqs2x3";
		reg = <0x44>;
