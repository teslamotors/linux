* NVIDIA Tegra Hardware Synchronization Primitives (HSP) bindings

Tegra HSP unit is designed to support synchronization among processors on the
SoC for various tasks where shared resources need to be accessed exclusively
or inter-processor communications support.

Required properties:

- compatible: should be "nvidia,tegra186-hsp"

- reg: base address and length of the HSP aperture

- interrupts: interrupts corresponding to interrupt-names

- interrupt-names: where applicable:
  - "doorbell":	CPU doorbell interrupt
  - "sharedN":	shared interrupt number N (N in 0..7)
  - "emptyN":	mailbox number N empty interrupt (N in 0..7)
  - "fullN":	mailbox number N full interrupt (N in 0..7)

- nvidia,doorbell: doorbell identifier of the local doorbell

Symbolic doorbell constants are defined in:
  <dt-bindings/platform/t186/tegra-hsp.h>
