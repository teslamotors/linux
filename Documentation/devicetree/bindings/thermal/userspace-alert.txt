* Userspace thermal alert cooling device node

Provides the facility for userspace to know whether a thermal alert
occurred or not for a perticular temperature trip value. This is Supported
by adding a Thermal cooling device.

This cooling device is intended with single trip point.

Required properties:
- compatible:           "userspace-therm-alert";

- cdev-type:		Name of cdev.
  Type: string
  Size: one cell

- #cooling-cells:       Provides cooling device specific information.
  Type: unsigned        Must be at least 2, to represent minimum followed
  Size: one cell        by maximum cooling state.

Optional properties:
- cooling-min-level:    The smallest cooling state.
  Type: unsigned
  Size: one cell

- cooling-max-level:    The largest cooling state.
  Type: unsigned
  Size: one cell

Examples:
	userspace-alert {
		compatible = "userspace-therm-alert";
		cdev-type = "userspace-alert";
		cooling-min-state = <0>;
		cooling-max-state = <1>;
		#cooling-cells = <2>;
	};

	thermal-zones {
		Tdiode{
			status = "okay";

			thermal-zone-params {
				governor-name = "pid_thermal_gov";
			};

			trips {
				trip_usr_alert {
					temperature = <60000>;
					type = "passive";
					hysteresis = <1>;
					writable;
				};
			};

			cooling-maps {
				map0 {
					trip = <&{/thermal-zones/Tdiode_tegra/trips/trip_usr_alert}>;
					cdev-type = "userspace-alert";
					cooling-device = <&{/userspace-alert} THERMAL_NO_LIMIT THERMAL_NO_LIMIT>;
				};
			};
		};
