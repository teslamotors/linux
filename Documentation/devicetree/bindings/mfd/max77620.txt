  interrupt request from internal sub-blocks like RTC, regulators, GPIOs as well
  as external input.
- #interrupt-cells: Should be set to 2 for IRQ number and flags.
  The first cell is the IRQ number. IRQ numbers for different interrupt source
  of MAX77620 are defined at dt-bindings/mfd/max77620.h
  The second cell is the flags, encoded as the trigger masks from binding document
	interrupts.txt, using dt-bindings/irq.

This device also support the power OFF and power reset of system.
Following properties are used for this purpose:
- maxim,system-pmic-power-off: Boolean, This device will be used for system
	power OFF. Host will issue i2c command to PMIC to power OFF system.

			If POK mapping is enabled for GPIO1/nRST_IO then,
			GPIO1/nRST_IO pins are HIGH only if all rails
			that have POK control enabled are HIGH.
			If any of the rails goes down(which are enabled for POK
			control) then, GPIO1/nRST_IO goes LOW.

			To know whether POK mapping to GPIO1/nRST_IO is
			enabled or not, refer MAX20024 data sheet.

			This property is valid for max20024 only.

		maxim,ramp-rate-setting:
			integer, ramp rate(uV/us) setting to be
			configured to the device.
			The platform may have different ramp
			rate than advertised ramp rate if it has
			design variation from Maxim's
			recommended. On this case, platform
			specific ramp rate is used for ramp time
			calculation and this property is used
			for device register configurations.
			The measured ramp rate of platform is
			provided by the regulator-ramp-delay
			as described in <devicetree/bindings/
			regulator/regulator.txt>.
			Maxim Max77620 supports following ramp
			delay:
			  SD: 13.75mV/us, 27.5mV/us, 55mV/us
			  LDOs: 5mV/us, 100mV/us

Note: If the measured ramp delay is same as advertised ramp delay then it is not
required to provide the ramp delay with property "maxim,ramp-rate-setting". The
ramp rate can be provided by the regulator-ramp-delay which will be used for
ramp time calculation for voltage change as well as for device configuration.
