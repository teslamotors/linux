Maxim MAX16989 Automotive Low-voltage 2-channel Step-Down controller.
Device supportss two voltage output and there is 2 sets of registers
for voltage output vout1 and vout2. These outputs are independent and
their input/control pins are also different. Theire is 2 i2c address
for the device, one for vout1 and other for vout2.

The properties defined here is single voltage output. Two nodes are
needed for 22 voltage outputs.

Required properties:
- compatible:	must be "maxim,max16989"
- reg:		The i2c slave address of the regulator.

Any standard regulator properties (Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/
regulator.txt) can be used to configure the voltage output of this device.

Optional properties:
- regulator-voltage-steps: Voltage steps. Must be 10000uV or 12500uV.
	Absence of this property will set voltage steps to 12500mV.
- maxim,enable-clk-spread-spectrum: Boolean, Enable clock 3% spread spectrum.
- maxim,enable-gpio: GPIO number connected to EN pin to enable/disable the
	voltage output.
- maxim,enable-external-fpwm: Boolean, enable extern control FPWM. The
	FPWM will be controlled by SYNC IO control signal.
- maxim,fpwm-sync-gpio: GPIO number connected to SYNC IO pin from Host to
	control the FPWM/SKIP mode. If valid GPIO is provided then external
	control of FPWM will be selected even if property "maxim,enable-
	external-fpwm" is not available.
- maxim,enable-sync-output: Boolean, Enable sync pin as output.
- maxim,tracking-device-i2c-address: I2C address of the MAX20024 which is
	used for LDO4 voltage tracking. If this property is available and
	voltage step is 12500uV then tracking will be enabled.
-maxim,slew-rate: Slew rate configuration for soft start and rising dvs
	in mV/us. Tables are
	Soft startup(mV/us)	Rising DVS (mV/us)	value

Maximum voltage is selected from regulator-max-microvolt property. If this
is not provided then it will be assumed that the maximum voltage is the
device supported maximum voltage.

All GPIOs numbers are provided as per the DT binding document
(Documentation/devicetree/bindings/gpio/gpio.txt).

Example:

	max16989@1b {
		compatible = "maxim,max16989";
		reg = <0x1b>;

		regulator-min-microvolt = <935000>;
		regulator-max-microvolt = <1200000>;
		maxim,enable-gpio = <&gpio 20 0>;
	};
