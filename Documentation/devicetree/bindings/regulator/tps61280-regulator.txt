* TI TPS61280 Voltage Regulator

Required properties:
- compatible:	must be "ti,tps61280".
- reg:		the i2c slave address of the regulator.

Any standard regulator properties (Documentation/binding/regulator/regulator.txt)
can be used to configure the TI TPS61280 Voltage output.

Optional properties:
VSEL Pin control: 
================ 
	Vsel pin is used for multiple functionality like as
		- DVS voltage selection
		- Sleep voltage control
		- Mode selection.
	Based on DT property of node, the desired function is selected.
DVS Voltage selection: As device has two VOUT register, the voltage output
	is selected by VSEL pin. The required properties to configure the
	DVS through VSEL pin is:
	ti,enable-vsel-controlled-dvs: boolean, Enable VSEL for DVS.
	ti,vsel-pin-gpio: GPIO number on which Host has connected to this
			device.
	ti,vsel-pin-default-state: u32, Default state of the VSEL pin
			during boot.

Sleep voltage control: As there is two voltage output registers, it can set
	for normal state vout and sleep state vout. On this case, the host
	can control the normal/sleep state vout via VSEL pin. Required
	properties to configure the sleep through VSEL pin is:
	ti,enable-vsel-controlled-sleep: boolean, Enable VSEL pin for
			Sleep control.
	ti,vsel-pin-default-state: Vsel default state for active mode.

Mode selection: VSEL pin is also used for selecting different mode i.e.
	force PWM vs auto PWM mode. The required properties to configure
	the mode through VSEL pin are:
	ti,enable-vsel-controlled-mode: boolean, enable mode control through
			VSEL pin.
	ti,vsel-pin-gpio: GPIO number on which host connected to this device
			for VSEL pin control.

	If property "ti,enable-vsel-controlled-mode" is not available then
	property "ti,vsel-pin-gpio" is not used and mode control is done via
	register access ia I2C.
	If property "ti,enable-vsel-controlled-mode" is available then
	mode control is done via the gpio "ti,vsel-pin-gpio".

Enable pin control:
================== 
	EN pin of device control the enable/disable of the regulator output.
	This pin can be controlled by host. The required properties for
	configuring regulator control via EN pin are:
	ti,enable-en-pin-control: Boolean, enable EN pin control.
	ti,en-pin-gpio: Enable pin GPIO to which host is connected.

	If property "ti,enable-en-pin-control" is not there then there is no
	meaning of property "ti,en-pin-gpio" and regulator is controlled by
	register access through I2C.
	If property "ti,enable-en-pin-control" is available then regulator
	enable/disable is done via toggling gpio "ti,en-pin-gpio".

	EN pin:
		HIGH: Regulator enable.
		LOW: Regulator disable.


nBYP pin (Bypass) control:
========================= 
	Bypass mode is controlled through the register configuration as well
	as via the nBYP pin. If bypass mode is controlled through nBYP pin
	then following properties are required:
	ti,enable-bypass-pin-control: Boolean, enable bypass pin control.
	ti,bypass-pin-gpio: Bypass pin GPIO to which host is connected.

	If property "ti,enable-bypass-pin-control" is not there then property
	"ti,bypass-pin-gpio" is not used and bypass configuration is done
	through register access via I2C.
	If property "ti,enable-bypass-pin-control" is there then bypass
	configuration is done via toggling gpio "ti,bypass-pin-gpio"

	Bypass OFF:
		nBYP LOW: pin is LOW
		device active in forced pass-through mode.
	Bypass ON:
		nByp high: Pin is HIGH
		device active in auto mode (dc/dc boost, pass through)

Example:

	tps61280@75 {
		compatible = "ti,tps61280";
		reg = <0x75>;
		regulator-name = "vdd-modem";
		regulator-min-microvolt = <3500000>;
		regulator-max-microvolt = <4000000>;
		regulator-init-microvolt = <3600000>;
		regulator-boot-on;
		regulator-always-on;
		regulator-bypass-on;

		ti,enable-en-pin-control;
		ti,en-pin-gpio = <&gpio TEGRA_GPIO(E, 0), 0>;

		ti,enable-bypass-pin-control;
		ti,bypass-pin-gpio = <&gpio TEGRA_GPIO(E, 5), 0>;

		ti,enable-vsel-controlled-mode;
		ti,vsel-pin-gpio = <&gpio TEGRA_GPIO(E, 1), 0>;
	};
