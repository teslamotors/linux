* LTR659 proximity sensor

Required properties:
- compatible: must be "lite-on,ltr659"
- reg: i2c address of the device. It is 0x23.
- threshold: threshold of proximity value to detect head near/far from sensor.
- vdd-supply: regulator supply for chip
- vled-supply: regulator supply for led anode.

Example:

	ltr659@23 {
		compatible = "lite-on,ltr659";
		reg = <0x23>;
		threshold = <125>;
		vdd-supply = <&palmas_smps9>;
		vled-supply = <&palmas_smps8>;
	};
