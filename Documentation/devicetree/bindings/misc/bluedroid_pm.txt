This driver is implemented to actively manage the bluetooth radio power and
control wake interface from bluetooth radio to host processor.
Two interfaces are used to manage bluetooth radio power

RFKILL: This interface is used to toggle rfkill switches which are controlled
by gpios and voltage regulators. This interface is created only when
bluetooth radio requires one of rfkill switches [GPIO/ Voltage regulators]
Driver assumes vdd_bt_3v3 as consumer name for 3V regulator and
vddio_bt_1v8 as consumer name for 1.8V regulator

PROCFS: Using procfs interface, driver controls BT chip ext_wake GPIO to
enable/disable BT chip LPM. This interface is created only when bluetooth
module supports LPM mode control using GPIO

This driver assumes platform data is passed from the board files to configure
IO parameters needed to control bluetooth radio.

Required Properties:
- compatible: Must be  "nvidia,tegra-bluedroid_pm";

Optional Properties:
- "bluedoird_pm,shoutdown-gpio" is resource name to register radio's Enable/Shutdown gpio
- "bluedoird_pm,reset-gpio" is resource name to regster radio's reset gpio
    One of above is mandatory requirement for registering rfkill interface.

- "bluedoird_pm,ext-wake-gpio" is resource name to register radio's ext_wake gpio
- "bluedoird_pm,host-wake-gpio" is resource name to register host wake gpio

Example:
bluedroid_pm {
	compatible = "nvidia,tegra-bluedroid_pm";
	id = <0>;
	bluedoird_pm,reset-gpio = <&gpio TEGRA_GPIO(X, 1) 0>;
	bluedoird_pm,host-wake-gpio = <&gpio TEGRA_GPIO(U, 6) 0>;
	bluedoird_pm,ext-wake-gpio = <&gpio TEGRA_GPIO(EE, 1) 0>;
	interrupt-parent = <&gpio>;
	interrupts = <166 0x01>;
};
