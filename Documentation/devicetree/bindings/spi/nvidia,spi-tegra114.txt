NVIDIA Tegra114 SPI controller.

Required properties:
- compatible : should be "nvidia,tegra114-spi".
- reg: Should contain SPI registers location and length.
- interrupts: Should contain SPI interrupts.
- nvidia,dma-request-selector : The Tegra DMA controller's phandle and
  request selector for this SPI controller.

Recommended properties:
- spi-max-frequency: Definition as per
                     Documentation/devicetree/bindings/spi/spi-bus.txt
Optional properties:
- nvidia,clock-always-on: Enable clock of spi always.
- nvidia,polling-mode: Use polling method instead of interrupts
- nvidia,boost-reg-access: In T210 and earlier chips SPI register access
	is dependant on SPI clock frequency. Setting this option would
	allow SPI clock frequency to be boosted. Benefitial when running
	SPI at low frequencies with cpu based transfers. Default false.
- nvidia,disable-runtime-pm: disable runtime power management for SPI.
	SPI uses very low power and runtime pm can be overhead for smaller
	transfers. This option allows disabling runtime pm.
- nvidia,maximum-dma-buffer-size: Maximum dma buffer size per transfer.
	If this is not available then 16K will be default. The value should
	be unit of byte.

spi-client device controller properties:
  Below properties should be defined under 'controller-data' child node
- nvidia,enable-hw-based-cs: (Boolean) Use the HW based CS if enabled.
- nvidia,tx-clk-tap-delay: Delays the clock going out to the external device
  with this tap value.
- nvidia,rx-clk-tap-delay: Delays the clock coming in from the external device
  with this tap value.
- nvidia,cs-setup-clk-count: CS setup timing parameter.
- nvidia,cs-hold-clk-count: CS hold timing parameter.
- nvidia,cs-inactive-cycles: Cycles to be inactive between two packets.
  CS Inactive between packets is disabled if value of this is zero.
- nvidia,clk-delay-between-packets: Clock delay  between packets by keeping
		CS active. For this, it is required to pass the Chip select
		as GPIO.
- nvidia,chipselect-gpio: Chipselect GPIO number as per gpio binding.

Example:
spi@7000d600 {
	compatible = "nvidia,tegra114-spi";
	reg = <0x7000d600 0x200>;
	interrupts = <0 82 0x04>;
	nvidia,dma-request-selector = <&apbdma 16>;
	spi-max-frequency = <25000000>;
	nvidia,clock-always-on;
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	status = "disabled";

	<spi-client>@<bus_num> {
		...
		...
		controller-data {
			nvidia,enable-hw-based-cs;
			nvidia,cs-setup-clk-count = <10>;
			nvidia,cs-hold-clk-count = <10>;
			nvidia,rx-clk-tap-delay = <0>;
			nvidia,tx-clk-tap-delay = <16>;
		};
		...
	};
};
