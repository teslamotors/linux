Intel(R) Dynamic Application Loader (Intel(R) DAL)
===================================================

Introduction
============

Intel Dynamic Application Loader (Intel DAL) is a service that runs
on the Intel Management Engine (Intel ME). It provides the ability to
install, run,  and interact with Trusted Applets - TAs,
written in subset of Java) in a secure environment.
---
installing applet int JHI and running them on Intel ME.

There are two interfaces to Intel DAL from the operating system.
One from the user space, called JHI and one from kernel space, called KDI.
User space applications can install and uninstall TAs, and both kernel
and user space applications can communicate with installed TAs.

Intel DAL Linux Kernel Driver
================
The driver supports both user space clients and kernel space clients.

For user space clients:
-----------------------
For each DAL FW client (IVM, SDM and RTM) the driver exposes a char device
called /dev/dal{i}, while i is 0-2 respectively.

The user space interface allows sending raw messages from user-space
to DAL FW client, without any modifications.
The driver will send back to the user the raw messages which was received back.
Usually this interface is used by JHI - the DAL SW (for more information
search dynamic-application-loader-host-interface in github)
The messages are sent by using the char device 'write' function,
and received by using the 'read' function in accordance.

For kernel space clients:
-------------------------
The driver expose api in <linux/dal.h> file, to allow a kernel space client
using DAL.

dal_uuid_to_bin - convert uuid string to bin
     Input uuid is in either hyphenless or standard format
    Arguments:
    	uuid_str:  uuid string
    	uuid:      output param to hold uuid bin

    Return:
    	0 on success
    	<0 on failure

dal_create_session - create session to an installed trusted application.
    Arguments:
    	session_handle:   output param to hold the session handle
    	ta_id:            trusted application (ta) id
    	acp_pkg           acp file of the ta
    	acp_pkg_len:      acp file length
    	init_param:       init parameters to the session (optional)
    	init_param_len:   length of the init parameters

    Return:
    	0 on success
    	<0 on system failure
    	>0 on DAL FW failure

dal_send_and_receive - send and receive data to/from ta
    Arguments:
        session_handle: session handle
    	command_id:     command id
    	input:          message to be sent
    	input_len:      sent message size
    	output:         An output parameter to hold a pointer
                        to the buffer which will contain the received
                        message.
                        This buffer is allocated by the driver and freed
                        by the user
    	output_len:     An input and output param -
                           - input: the expected maximum length
                             of the received message.
                           - output: size of the received message
    	response_code:  An output parameter to hold the return
                        value from the applet

    Return:
    	0 on success
    	<0 on system failure
    	>0 on DAL FW failure

dal_close_session - close ta session
    Arguments:
session_handle: session handle

    Return:
    	0 on success
    	<0 on system failure
    	>0 on DAL FW failure

dal_set_ta_exclusive_access - set client to be owner of the ta,
                              so no one else (especially user space client)
                              will be able to open session to it
    Arguments:
    	ta_id: trusted application (ta) id

    Return:
    	0 on success
    	-ENODEV when the device can't be found
    	-ENOMEM on memory allocation failure
    	-EPERM when ta is owned by another client
    	-EEXIST when ta is already owned by current client

dal_unset_ta_exclusive_access - unset client from owning ta
    Arguments:
    	ta_id: trusted application (ta) id

    Return:
    	0 on success
    	-ENODEV when the device can't be found
    	-ENOENT when ta isn't found in exclusiveness ta list
    	-EPERM when ta is owned by another client

dal_get_version_info - return DAL driver version
    Arguments:
    	version_info: output param to hold DAL driver version information

    Return:
    	0 on success
    	-EINVAL on incorrect input
